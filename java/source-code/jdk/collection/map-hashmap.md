# `HashMap<K,V>`

## 设计

链地址法，链上条目超过8个转红黑树。红黑树小于 6 退化成链。

## 扩容策略

```java
/**
    * The default initial capacity - MUST be a power of two.
    */
static final int DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY = 1 << 4; // aka 16


/**
* The bin count threshold for using a tree rather than list for a
* bin.  Bins are converted to trees when adding an element to a
* bin with at least this many nodes. The value must be greater
* than 2 and should be at least 8 to mesh with assumptions in
* tree removal about conversion back to plain bins upon
* shrinkage.
*/
static final int TREEIFY_THRESHOLD = 8;

/**
* The bin count threshold for untreeifying a (split) bin during a
* resize operation. Should be less than TREEIFY_THRESHOLD, and at
* most 6 to mesh with shrinkage detection under removal.
*/
static final int UNTREEIFY_THRESHOLD = 6;

/**
* The smallest table capacity for which bins may be treeified.
* (Otherwise the table is resized if too many nodes in a bin.)
* Should be at least 4 * TREEIFY_THRESHOLD to avoid conflicts
* between resizing and treeification thresholds.
*/
static final int MIN_TREEIFY_CAPACITY = 64;
```

达到阈值直接扩容为原来两倍

```java
/**
 * Initializes or doubles table size.  If null, allocates in
 * accord with initial capacity target held in field threshold.
 * Otherwise, because we are using power-of-two expansion, the
 * elements from each bin must either stay at same index, or move
 * with a power of two offset in the new table.
 *
 * @return the table
 */
final Node<K,V>[] resize() {}
